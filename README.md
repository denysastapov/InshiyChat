## Project Overview
ChatApp is a modern iOS chat application built using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. It offers a sleek and minimalist design aimed at providing users with an intuitive and pleasant chatting experience. By adhering to MVVM principles, the codebase is organized, maintainable, and scalable.

## Key Features
### MVVM Architecture
The app follows the MVVM architectural pattern, separating concerns between the data layer, presentation layer, and user interface.

### Firebase Integration 
Firebase is used as the backend infrastructure, providing secure and scalable cloud services for real-time data synchronization, authentication, and database storage.

### Keychain Security 
User authentication tokens are securely stored using the Keychain framework, ensuring data privacy and protection against unauthorized access.

### Modern Design 
With a focus on simplicity and elegance, ChatApp sports a modern and minimalist design aesthetic, ensuring a visually appealing user interface.

### Enhanced User Experience: 
Leveraging best practices and user feedback, ChatApp prioritizes user experience, offering features such as real-time messaging, push notifications, and intuitive navigation.

### UIColor Hex Extension
A UIColor extension is incorporated into the codebase, allowing the representation of colors using hexadecimal codes. This feature simplifies color management and contributes to a more readable and concise styling implementation.

### User Registration Validation
Stringent validation logic is applied to all user registration fields to ensure data integrity. The validation includes checks for various criteria, adding robustness to the registration process.

### Keyboard Helper and Utility Helpers
The application includes a Keyboard Helper utility that intelligently manages the user interface, providing a seamless text input experience. Additionally, various utility helpers enhance the overall functionality of the application, contributing to user convenience.
